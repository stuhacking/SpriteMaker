Sprite Maker
============

This is a utility to automate building a texture atlas (sprite sheet) from a
sample scene. Opening a directory containing images will display the individual
images in the right hand pane. Clicking (or marquee selecting) on the left
hand canvas will drop instances of that sprite in place (aligned to the grid
size specified along the bottom.)

Exporting an image will pack unique sprites into a texture sheet with power
of 2 dimensions.

After selecting a bunch of sprites and giving them an optional description, the saved document will look like this:
